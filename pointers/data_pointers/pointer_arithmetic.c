    /*
    
    a[i], the compiler does a calculation for you. It takes the starting address of the array (a) and then adds i * sizeof(int) to it.
    ptr++ adds 1 * sizeof(*ptr) to the address. But here's the key difference: that 1 * sizeof(*ptr) is a simple, constant calculation. It's the same in every single iteration of the loop.

    On the other hand, the a[i] loop has a variable that changes in every iterationâ€”the i index. So the compiler has to do a new multiplication (i * sizeof(int)) every time.
    A multiplication with a variable is a bit more work for the computer than a simple addition.
