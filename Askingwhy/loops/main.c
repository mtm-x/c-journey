/**
 * TODO: 
 *  Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the user. The pro-
    gram must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one. When the user enters 0 or a nega-
    tive number, the program must display the largest nonnegative number entered:
    Enter a number: 60
    Enter a number: 38.3
    Enter a number: 4.89
    Enter a number: 100.62
    Enter a number: 75.2295
    Enter a number: 0
    The largest number entered was 100.62
    Notice that the numbers aren’t necessarily integers.
